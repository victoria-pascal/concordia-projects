# Snakes and Ladders

This program is a command line Snakes and Ladders game for 2 players. 
The program will first ask for the number of players, but will only allow 2 players per game.
Then it will decide who will be the first player to start their turn by rolling the dice.

The game will print the actions and the board for each turn. 
Players will pass their turns by pressing 'Enter'.
The game will continue until one of the players reaches exactly 100.

***NOTE***: The application should be run in the standalone terminal!
