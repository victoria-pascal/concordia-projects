# Circular Linked List Books Catalogue

This is an interactive program that:
  - reads a file with Book records
  - identifies book records with invalid year and saves them into an ArrayList, then writes to a separate file
  - stores the correct book records in a circular linked list
  - allows to navigate through the list and change it
